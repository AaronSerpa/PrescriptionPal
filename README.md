To whoever is reading this right now, that means you are now in the development team for PrescriptionPal, so congratulations!  You may have several questions right now and hopefully this README will answer many of them and help you get started. First, we recommend that you have both a GitHub account as well as a ZenHub account. The GitHub account will be where many of the code will be uploaded to and reviewed by your fellow developers. For the ZenHub account, it will be where each developer will pick up a task or feature to do and finish and see if the team is making good progress. It is part of the agile/scrum development process that we are doing.

Once you have entered the PrescriptionPal GitHub and picked up a task, it is time to get started. First, let’s go over our branching structure and how to correctly branch off so that we do not mess with each other’s code. The main two branches are the master branch and the features branch. The master branch will be the branch that is released to the public and is what the users will be using. The features branch is the branch where the developers will collaborate their individual branches and make sure that no bugs are found when merged. Once you understand these two branches, then you are free to open up a new branch for your individual feature or whatever you signed up for on the ZenHub. Once you are finished with the task, it is recommended that each developer create a pull request so that other developers are able to check and review your code for any initial bugs. After that is completed and the branch is ready to be merged into the features branch, you are free to do so. If we are preparing to release the current version to the public, but you notice a bug, feel free to create a new mini-branch so that you and other developers can solve the bug and merge back into features! Once the features branch is ready, the team as a whole will decide to merge the features branch into main for the public.

Next, let us go over how to set up the coding environment for our application. The primary IDE that we are using is Android Studio. Once that is installed onto your computer, you can go to any branch on our GitHub and clone it onto a directory on your computer. After that, you can go into Android Studio and open up a project by going to that directory you just cloned and open up the build.grade file. You may get an initial error where the IDE is unable to locate a certain file because the directory leads to another developer’s computer, it will be fixed automatically so do not worry. Once the build is loaded in, the developer is now free to code!

A few things to note. Make sure you contact our database manager so that you are added into the Firebase project so you can access our database and FireStore. This will be exceptionally helpful to retrieve and save data. Also for Android Studio, it is extremely recommended for you to download an emulator that Android Studio can run. We recommend an Android 8 emulator.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact any of the developers for help. And thank you for joining the development team for PrescriptionPal!
